level and ability cap increaser 1.0 Mod (laci 1.0)

What does it do?
- This mod increases the level AND the ability cap to level 20.
- This mod removes the helm restrictions for Godlike. Their boons are worth nothing at level 20 and so this restriction is no longer justified.
- This mod removes the bonus xp for smaller parties and the penalty for not-in-Party-PCs. Main PC and all other Party PC always get 130% of the base xp. Exception are PCs on Adventure. They get the +X% xp extra.

How to install?
- Just extract the archive into the main Pillars of Eternity folder.
